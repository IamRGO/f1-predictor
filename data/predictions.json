    },
    "reason": "As F1 enters a new era in 2026, Max Verstappen remains the benchmark for performance, especially following his dominant end to the 2025 season. Oscar Piastri carries significant momentum into his home race after a strong 2025 campaign and 'optimistic' reports from the Bahrain pre-season tests. George Russell is predicted for the final podium spot as Mercedes historically excels during major technical and power unit regulation shifts, having finished 2025 with consistent podium appearances."
