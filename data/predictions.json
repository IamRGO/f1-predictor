    "reason": "McLaren dominated the 2025 season with Norris winning the championship and Piastri securing multiple victories. Entering 2026, McLaren remains the team to beat, and Piastri is favored to win his home race ahead of his teammate. Despite internal management changes at Red Bull, Verstappen's consistent podium record throughout 2025 makes him the most likely candidate to round out the top three."
