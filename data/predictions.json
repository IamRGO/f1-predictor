    "reason": "Oscar Piastri carries immense momentum from a dominant 2025 season into his home race in Melbourne. While reports of a Mercedes engine loophole suggest George Russell will be highly competitive under the new 2026 regulations, Piastri's form and McLaren's recent track record make him the favorite, with Verstappen remaining a consistent podium threat despite his vocal concerns about the new car's handling."
