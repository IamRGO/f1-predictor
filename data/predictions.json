    "reason": "Lando Norris enters the 2026 season as the defending World Champion following a dominant 2025 campaign and a win at the previous Australian GP. McLaren's momentum, combined with Oscar Piastri's exceptional performance in 2025 and home-circuit advantage, suggests a McLaren 1-2. Max Verstappen remains the most consistent challenger to the McLarens despite internal leadership transitions at Red Bull."
